# Shtarkman_Daniel
Hola! My name is Daniil, but I mostly prefer to be called Daniel 😊. Right now, I am studying such things as JavaScript, Html and ReactJs, but also learning Python on my own. 
Despite this, as a hobby, I enjoy practising Unreal Engine 5 with additional modules using BluePrint and MetaHuman.
My native language is Russian, but I have high English skills as well.
Interested in making apps, programms and websites for different platforms, such as Windows, Linux and Android.

Dreaming of creating my own large-scale video game 🐲
